üï∏Ô∏è Not quite a blog, but not a timeline either. This kind of personal wiki of linked notes is my attempt to gradually move away from social media platforms but still keep some kind of connection with the public internet.

This "net of notes" is very close to the idea of a digital garden, in that it takes inspiration from the early web; from [hypertext](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html) and the [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex), and from keeping some kind of ownership of the files one shares. In keeping with these ideas, the notes in this garden are often drafts that are meant to grow (or wither) organically. Some notes might make it into larger projects or [[Publications/All publications|publications]], many will stay as notes while they grow.

You can read [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), and this piece on [The Garden and the Stream](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) to find out more about digital gardens.
