I am very happy that my book is coming coming out in 2024 with [Edinburgh University Press](https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/book-cinema-and-machine-vision.html)
Here a teaser from the back cover:

>_Cinema and Machine Vision_ unfolds the aesthetic, epistemic, and ideological dimensions of machine-seeing films and television using computers. With its critical-technical approach, this book presents to the reader key new problems that arise as AI becomes integral to visual culture. It theorises machine through a selection of aesthetics, film theory, and applied machine learning research, dispelling widely held assumptions about computer systems designed to watch and make images on our behalf. 

I am doing a book launch event, recording a special episode of the [Video Essay Podcast](https://thevideoessay.com/) with [Will DiGravio](https://www.willdigravio.com/), as part of King's AI festival. [Register here](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/events/cinema-and-machine-vision).

The podcast is now available, and you can [[book|win a copy of the book here!]]

## Endorsements

> Cinema and machine vision rescaled the world, from cell to pixel, detail to data. Daniel　Chavez Heras shows us the parallel and diverging ways they have become worldmaking. A wonderful and necessary book that starts the story of AI where it should be started: in much earlier technical imaging practices of cinema.

> – Professor Jussi Parikka, Aarhus University, author of _Operational Images_


>This ambitious and imaginative book explores how we can teach machines to watch films without taking away from our human pleasure of doing so. Equally well versed in the technical discourse of computer vision and the cultural theory of visuality, Daniel Chávez Heras issues an invitation to us all to envisage new ways of seeing and making with AI.
