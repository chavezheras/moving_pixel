I was an invited (together with [Libby Heaney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libby_Heaney)) to speak at the LND Creative AI meetup series, hosted by the Goethe-Institut in London. This was one of the first public talks I gave about [[Computational Spectatorship]]. Thanks to [Luba Elliott](https://twitter.com/elluba) for the invitation.
