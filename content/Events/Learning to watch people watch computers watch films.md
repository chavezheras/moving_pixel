I was invited as a speaker at a workshop organised by the [AdA project](https://projectada.github.io/). Info below from their website.

>The interdisciplinary research group “Audio-Visual Rhetorics of Affect” is an ongoing collaboration (2017-2021) between the [film studies department](https://www.ada.cinepoetics.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html) of [Freie Universtät Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/) and the [Semantic Technologies Group](https://hpi.de/meinel/knowledge-tech/former-topics/semantics.html) of the [Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Engineering (HPI)](https://hpi.de/en/index.html) in Potsdam.
