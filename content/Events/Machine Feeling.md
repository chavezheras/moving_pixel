Mini-marathon of talks resulting from a research workshop organised by [Transmediale](https://transmediale.de/en) and [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/) in cooperation with the [Digital Humanities programme at Cambridge University](https://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/). I was part of the panel “Seeing Things”, with Tomasz Hollanek, Rosemary Lee and Carleigh Morgan. Moderated by Geoff Cox.

Some years later I was very happy to contribute to this workshop again, at [[Transmediale 2023]], that time also supporting PhD students as they were developing their contributions.
