In this workshop we explored technical aspects of machine learning technologies that are increasingly being used by artists, museums and galleries. It was an encounter between cultural researchers, gallerists and technical experts. The event is part of a series organised by the [Creative AI Lab](https://creative-ai.org/) based in the [Department of Digital Humanities](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh) at King's College London, in collaborations with the [Serpentine Galleries](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/).
