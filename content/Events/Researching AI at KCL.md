[Researching AI at KCL](https://kingsdh.net/2022/11/04/researching-ai/)

>Please join us to discuss AI and how to research it from a humanities point of view. We will present new research in progress from the much hyped text-to-image systems and the ‘calculation of meaning’ to trustworthiness in AI, so join Kate Devlin, Daniel Chavez Heras and Mercedes Bunz in this upcoming event hosted by The Digital Humanities Lecture series.

My presentation discusses the notion of _Computational Ekphrasis_ as a way to analyse text-to-image systems such as [DALL·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) and [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-v2-release), this talk will tease out some of the broader implications of describing images into existence for visual culture and society.
