During day two, [[Mila Oiva|Mila]] and [[Andrea Farina|Andrea]] worked on a series of guidelines for human annotation of the the soviet news reels, focusing on scenes or "blocs", rather than stories.
Tags include:

- Time stamps of the blocs
- Topics of the blocs
- Settings or locations
- Sound change over blocs

These were thought as a possible new sources of data from human annotators, but also as sampling guidelines to inform the list of [[day two|CLIP queries]].
