In the computational cluster we had [[Nanne van Noord|Nanne van Noord]], [[Carlo Bretti|Carlo Bretti]], and [[Andrea Farina|Andrea Farina]]. They shared with the workshop the challenges of analysing moving images using units at different scales, e.g. pixels, shots, scenes, films, archives.See for example this table from my article on [[Creanalytics|Creanalytics]]:

|Artefact|Processing level|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Cinema|Social – aggregate|Popular Hollywood cinema|
|Film|Human|Jurassic Park ([1993](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13548565231174592#bibr63-13548565231174592))|
|Clip|Human/computer|Raptors in the Kitchen Scene ([https://youtu.be/dnRxQ3dcaQk](https://youtu.be/dnRxQ3dcaQk))|
|Shot|Human-computer|130 frames (5.421 s)|
|Frame|Computer/human|Individual frame (512 × 340 pixels)|
|Pixels|Numeric – disaggregate|Vector ([176800x1]); Tensor ([16, 3, 340, 512])|


This cluster also highlighted the difficulties of encoding weak conventions or tacit knowledge, which echoes some of the concerns of the [[collections|collections]] cluster and the work of [[Pauline van Mourik Broekman|Pauline]]. Later, during the ideation sessions, we came back for example to the idea of detecting "scenes" or "blocs" which are defined by semantic convention and defined [[Annotation guidelines|annotation guidelines]] for this kind of unit.
