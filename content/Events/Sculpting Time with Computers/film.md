In the film cluster we had [[Belén Vidal|Belén Vidal]], [[Tom Brown|Tom Brown]], and [[Isadora Campregher|Isadora Campregher]].

They brought our attention issues of embodied spectatorship, including the difficulties of encoding  [[high-level reasoning about time|high-level reasoning about time]] and [[subjective time|subjective time]], which are needed to understand complex representations such as age in film. These levels were seen as mostly inaccessible to existing computational methods, and easily mobilised by human viewers.

It was interesting to see some of these limitations having correspondences in the [[computational|computational]] cluster discussion about units of analysis.
