A screening/demo/lecture I gave at [Birkbeck Institute for the Moving Image (BIMI)](http://blogs.bbk.ac.uk/bimi/) as part of the [Vasari Research Centre for Art and Technology](http://www.bbk.ac.uk/vasari/work/daniel-chavez-heras-learning-to-watch-films-with-computers-sketches-of-a-macroscopic-avant-garde/) lecture series. Through a series of examples I discussed the concept of _computational spectatorship_, in a cinema, in front of a live audience, for almost three hours! It was great and intense. Thanks to the wonderful [Catherine Grant](https://catherinegrant.org/) for the invitation.
