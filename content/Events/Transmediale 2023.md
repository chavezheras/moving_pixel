I attended [Transmediale](https://2023.transmediale.de/en) and gave a very small presentation as part of the panel *Toward Minor Tech*.

[![Towards a Minor Tech Newspaper](assets/images/minor_tech_news.jpeg)](https://darc.au.dk/fileadmin/DARC/newspapers/toward-a-minor-tech-online-sm.pdf)

This is the result of a workshop organised by by Geoff Cox and Christian Ulrik Andersen every year as part of [SHAPE Digital Citizenship](https://shape.au.dk/en/) & [Digital Aesthetics Research Center, Aarhus University](https://darc.au.dk/) and [Centre for the Study of the Networked Image, London South Bank University](https://www.centreforthestudyof.net/), this year in collaboration with [Kingâ€™s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/). 

The workshop took place over several days in London and inlcuded public talks from Marloes de Valk on the [damaged earth catalog](https://damaged.bleu255.com/) and from Tung-Hui Hu on [digital lethargy](https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/whats-on/talk-digital-lethargy).
My contribution to the publication was titled: *The Digital Pastoral: A minor critique of minor tech* and can be found [as a PDF](https://darc.au.dk/fileadmin/DARC/newspapers/toward-a-minor-tech-online-sm.pdf)along with all other contributions. I also made [[The Digital Pastoral|an AI image about the Digital Pastoral]] to go with this presentation.
