üõ†Ô∏è My job title at King's College London is [Lecturer in Digital Culture and Creative Computing](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/daniel-chavez-heras). The "and" is a key aspect of my profile. On the digital culture side, I specialise in visual culture, with a focus on screen cultures: film and television, online video, and computer games. This is mostly under the umbrella of [aesthetics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-concept/), [technoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technoscience) and [historical poetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_poetics). On the computational side, my work mostly sits between [cultural analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_analytics) and [computational creativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_creativity), with a focus on the analysis and production of visual media through methods borrowed and adapted from computer vision and multi-modal machine learning more generally (the type of technologies that underpin what is now commonly called _generative AI_). My research combines these fields and their methods in various ways, the common thread being the notion of [critical technical practice](https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/critical.html).

In my work I aim to integrate concepts from various theories of cinema, photography, aesthetics, and philosophy more generally, with advanced computational practice, such as computational modelling, time-series analysis, and machine learning. To get a flavour of this kind of work, see for example:

- This [[Projects/Creanalytics|parametric supercut generator]] I made using shot-scale detection
- [[Projects/Made by Machine|An experimental AI-TV programme]] made in collaboration with BBC R&D
- [[Projects/Focal length classifier|A focal length classifier]]I built to test the idea of an optical perspective in computer vision

I regularly present these and other [[Projects/]] at various [[All events|events]]. Some of these experiments and ideas have become projects and [[Publications|publications]], and a more comprehensive account of recent research can be found in my new book [Cinema and Machine Vision](https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/book-cinema-and-machine-vision.html) (Edinburgh University Press, 2024).
