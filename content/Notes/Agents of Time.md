# Agents of Time
## Reflections on algorithmic film making and generative AI

There is a rich tradition in experimental film making that incorporates various types of procedural and calculation systems, some of which predate the mass adoption of digital computing. In this presentation I focus on a subset of practices in this tradition that treat films as "machines made of images" and approach visual meaning-making through the programming of these machines. I revisit these films and their algorithmic practices to inform critical thought about contemporary generative AI, through the aesthetics of 

My goal in revisiting these films and their algorithmic practices is to explore two related aspects of what might be the same problem: how to us

how they can be useful to frame critical thought about contemporary generative AI, and if they offer clues 


broader reflection and critique of contemporary generative AI systems: how they dislocate
