[Ingrid Robeyns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingrid_Robeyns)
#Limitarianism: the view that there should be an upper limit  to how much personal wealth a person is allowed to accumulate. See: [Having Too Much](https://www.uu.nl/en/publication/having-too-much-philosophical-essays-on-limitarianism).
- The super rich are not happier, on the contrary.
- They are bad for the environment.
- A moral lower limit after which you are personal responsible to do something with your money that benefits society. £1 million.
- An upper limit enforced politically. £10 million.
- Aligned with [Piketty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Piketty) and [Zucman](https://gabriel-zucman.eu/): shifting the tax base from labour to capital, closing tax heavens, progressive taxation.
- Limitarianism: outcomes-oriented, [Rawls’ third principle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rawls/).

“[Enough: Why it’s time to abolish the super-rich](https://highpaycentre.org/enough-why-its-time-to-abolish-the-super-rich/)” by Luke Hildyard, kind of right wing-ish.

- Not a catastrophe if the super rich leave.
- Not proportional to the benefit they bring, even to their corporations, e.g. weak correlation between CEO pay and company performance.
- Not hurting them at all if they are not allowed to accumulate.
- Redistribution and pre-distribution
- Not anti-growth but not dependent on growth
- Not especially left wing
