>JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.

It has a [live editor](https://mermaid.live/) for non-programmers, and has [some tutorials](https://mermaid.js.org/config/Tutorials.html). Maybe relevant for students. There's a Jupyter integration too. Interesting for #criticaltechnicalpractice 
Maybe I can use this to render an maintain a web version of the VANGE diagram in my office.

Mermaid is supported by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)!
