Quick notes on video generation

- See [Runway's GEN-1](https://twitter.com/karenxcheng/status/1627721862565482496?s=20)for an out of the box solution.

- See [this thread](https://twitter.com/CoffeeVectors/status/1628475607846727687?s=20) about video generation using #stablediffusion  and #controlnet

- See [this hugging face space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fffiloni/ControlNet-Video) for more on #controlnet 

- This [community pipeline](https://github.com/nateraw/stable-diffusion-videos) of the diffusers library that takes 2 or more text prompts as arguments and outputs a "walk" interpolation as a sequence of generated images.
