### 1. Overview
Two (2) hardback copies of [[Notes/Cinema and Machine Vision|Cinema and Machine Vision]] will be given away as gifts to listeners of the [Video Essay Podcast](https://thevideoessay.com/). By participating you agree with the below terms and conditions. This is a friendly academic book giveaway draw and in that spirit I intend to keep T&Cs to a minimum. If you have any questions, please [[Contact|contact me]].

### 2. Terms and conditions for participation
Participants hereby acknowledge that they are adult individuals with a valid postal address.
Participation does not guarantee winning a book or receiving any other form of compensation.
The winners will be selected by me (Daniel) based on my personal opinion of the answers submitted by participants. By participating you agree to this selection process and essentially trust me to make this decision in a fair manner. I reserve the right to cancel or declare the draw concluded or not viable at any point.
There will be a maximum of two winners who will be informed by email and asked to provide a valid postal address. This can be international but please note that the books will be sent through standard post only. Daniel and Will accept no liability or responsibility for potential loss, damage, or delay in receiving copies of the book due to standard post processes.
There is no alternative prize or cash equivalent, and no option to re-post the book if it doesn't arrive. The only commitment to send once a single copy of the book by post to the winners.
The winners will be announced in September through Daniel's website (https://movingpixel.net/) and in later episodes of the Video Essay Podcast (https://thevideoessay.com/)  
 
### 3. Data protection
I will collect the responses directly using the form on my website. I will not use your name or email for any purpose other than this contest. I will contact the winners by email to ask for the postal address. All collected data will be destroyed after the winners are announced and before the end of 2024. I will never share your name and/or email with anyone outside of the strict need to contact you for the purposes of this draw. By participating you agree to these terms and conditions for data collection and retention.
