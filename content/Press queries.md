ðŸ“° I am available to discuss topics related to **AI** and digital culture, specifically **visual culture** and **computational creativity** (creative AI).

Specific areas where I can offer insight and expertise to journalists include:

- AI and creative industries (especially film, TV, video platforms and videogames)
- Generative AI and synthetic media, including technical expertise about large language and vision models, as well as social and cultural implications of their widespread use (e.g. vision, text-to-image and text-to-video models such as LLaVA, Stable Diffusion, DALLE and SORA)
- Machine Vision (how machine are taught to see and the implications for society)
- Computational Humanities (cultural analytics, computational modelling of cultural phenomena, visualisation and simulation)
- Visual and Computational Cultures (past and present, non-AI generative methods, analogue computing, algorithmic visual art)
- Media history, theory, and technology (especially early cinema and historical poetics)

If you're interested in featuring my research in a publication, podcast, or online platform, please [[Contact|get in touch]] . I'm happy to provide quotes, participate in interviews, and always keen to talk to committed journalists. I do not usually comment or discuss the performance or outlook of individual companies. Instead I am more likely to contribute to pieces that aim to demystify these technologies and focus public discourse on their real potentials and consequences. I can convey to your audience what these models are, how they work, what they can and cannot do, and why we should care about them beyond their novelty.

You can [[Contact|contact me]] directly, or through [my institution's press office](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news). Please include the media outlet, type of contribution you seek, and timeline to publish. If you need a [[About me (bio)|short bio click here]].
