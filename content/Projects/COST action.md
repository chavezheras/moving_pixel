Notes on COST action application.

See the newly approved COST actions here: https://www.cost.eu/uploads/2024/05/oc-2023-1-Approved-Actions-Booklet.pdf

Examples that peeked my interest:
- Language Plurality in Europe’s Changing Media Sphere (p.8)
Three part structure: the situation/challenge, the intervention, and the expected results.
> "Bring coherence to the field of European media from the perspective of language plurality

- Connecting Critical Pedagogies, Inclusive Art Forms and Alternative Barometers for Urban Sustainability
Mentions WGs and thematic areas.

- Genetic Nature Observation and Action (p.24)
> While genetic diversity data and indicators are available, they are often not integrated into species management and monitoring schemes in Europe due to a lack of capacity.  Furthermore, current national policies and practices have not yet ‘adapted’ to the new Global Biodiversity Framework. 

- Connecting Landscape Architecture Archives to enhance European landscape practice, research and education (p.31)
> ...its archives will now be used as a resource to create a comprehensive pan-European narrative of landscape history.
> ...the archives can be used as knowledge sources for innovative research and education. 
> building a community of practice to continue to promote international access to data and support the creation of new archives and collections, particularly in ITCs, where the majority of the team are based.

- Managing Artificial Intelligence in Archaeology (p. 44)
>The MAIA COST Action will create a community of archaeologists, digital archaeologists and computer scientists who will work together to develop a shared understanding of AI applications in archaeology. This will include meetings and workshops bringing together researchers who wish to create or use digital collections and training data.

What, how, why, for whom and by whom structure is very clear. 

- Artistic Intelligence - Responsiveness, accessibility, responsibility, equity
> The Action responds to the lack of common standards, challenging isolated, non- referenced research processes across the arts and culture. It aims to link emerging initiatives in practice-based research by exploring current technological possibilities for accessing, linking and validating them within a common framework of artistic intelligence.
