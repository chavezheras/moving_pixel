## ARCAM-net 

Europe has a rich tapestry of audiovisual cultures, from historical newsreels to specialised industrial video archives to some of the largest and oldest film and television collections in the world. Audiovisual cultural heritage is preserved in local and national archives, institutes, libraries, and other cultural institutions, usually with a mission to make these moving images available to newer and wider audiences. With the dramatic growth of born-digital video in the past two decades, delivering this mission requires a new set of specialised computational methods, tools and infrastructures. Several ad hoc initiatives have emerged in recent years, but they remain scattered across countries and institutions, with no coherent knowledge and technical integration to guide the push towards this new wave of technological development.

The International Network for Advanced Research in Computational Audiovisual Media (ARCAM-net) aims to integrate knowledge and technology from film and media scholarship, computer science and engineering, and audiovisual heritage and preservation science. The objective of this deep epistemic and methodological integration is to articulate the value between past and future media through a common R&D framework, with an emphasis on advanced computing technologies and equitable models of interaction that enable access, historical understanding, and creative use of audiovisual archives and collections.

ARCAM-net will deliver on this goal by 1) mapping existing initiatives across countries and institutions; 2) integrating these pockets of expertise to articulate a common research agenda; and 3) developing a coherent sector-wide R&D framework that connects heritage institutions with creative industries.


Subject: Invitation to Join ARCAM-net

Dear \[recipient's name],

Following up from our workshop in Amsterdam last month, you will recall we (Nanne, Mila and Nanne) are putting together a bid to fund a research network through a COST Action. 

 Expanding our existing collaboration, the international network for Advanced Research in Computational Audiovisual Media (ARCAM-net) aims to integrate knowledge, methods, and tools from film and media scholarship, computer science and engineering, and audiovisual heritage and archival science. The objective is to build towards a shared research programme that enables access, understanding, and creative use of audiovisual archives and collections.
 
I am writing to ask if you would like to join this COST Action as a proposer. We expect to assemble a wide network of proposers, including one academic, industry, and heritage person per country. Being a proposer does no involve having institutional support at this stage, only committing some of your time to feed into the proposal, including creating an e-profile in the COST web platform and being available to share your expertise with us to inform the bid. As a proposer you will help shape the network as it grows, and benefit from access to funded networking activities that can be linked to your own research/country/institution. See the COST Action website for more information.

If you are interested, I can forward a one-page document with more details about our proposed network, and include you in our dedicated communications to develop the bid going forward. I hope you consider joining us!

Let me know if you have any questions or want to have a quick call to discuss.

\[name]


You can have a light touch involvement, are expected to be responsive to questions by the principal proponents during the development of the proposal. The bid will need to be balanced between countries, disciplines, and types of institutions. 
If you're interested, I'd like to invite you to participate in ARCAM-net by:

1. Creating an e-profile on our proposal finder's web platform, outlining your research interests, background, and expertise related to audiovisual cultural heritage and technology development.
2. Providing specific contributions towards the content of our COST Action proposal, such as mapping existing initiatives across countries and institutions or integrating pockets of expertise to articulate a common research agenda.
3. Engaging in light touch involvement during the proposal's development phase while remaining responsive to questions posed by principal proponents.
4. Participating in events hosted by your institution, which will be linked to your ongoing research and funding opportunities within ARCAM-net.

We value your expertise and believe that your contribution will be instrumental in making ARCAM-net a success. I sincerely hope you consider joining us on this exciting endeavor, as we aim to shape the future of audiovisual cultural heritage preservation and technological advancements across Europe and beyond.

Thank you for considering our invitation! We look forward to collaborating with you in developing ARCAM-net into a world-class interdisciplinary research network.

Best regards,

How can this be done? --> solutions to problems
How can this be known? --> problems of knowledge

The goal of the PhD is not to find solutions, but to define and create new parameters for knowledge. 

Forget solutions, and what you want to do, and focus on what you want to know and how.

for their access, historical understanding, and contemporary creative use.


This connection is envisioned in three stages: 1) fundamental research that integrates tools and methods from moving image studies and computer science and engineering; 2) computational exploration and analysis of large audiovisual archives; 3) development of new media formats and services designed to make screen culture available to new audiences. The creation of the ARCAM network aims to enable the first of these stages.

At the same time, there is growing awareness of the enormous cultural and economic value of these collections in a media landscape that is increasingly hybrid in its modes of address and data-driven in its range of products and services. 

The ARCAM network aims to articulate this value between past and future media through interdisciplinary research, with an emphasis on advanced computing technologies and equitable models of exploration, applications and implications of emerging kinds of interaction with and through media.

To accomplish this, our proposed network has the following core objectives that underpin the first stage of fundamental research and disciplinary integration:

1. Map the landscape of research initiatives, methodologies, and tools scattered across universities, archives, institutes, and private entities working in the computational analysis of audiovisual media across Europe.
    
2. Integrate these various pockets of expertise, practices, tools, and infrastructures focused on the computational analysis and production of audiovisual media, to articulate common research challenges and a shared research agenda.
    
3. Develop a coherent interdisciplinary research framework, based on an ecumenical approach to advanced computing, rooted in domain expertise, open science, and a deep cultural understanding.
    

Our focus is on the computational modelling of audiovisual media as complex cultural phenomena, including the multimodal relations between sound, images, and language, as they unfold in cinematic time, but also the embodied conditions of viewership and interpretation that evolve historically from sustained interaction with this kind of media.Â  Central to ARCAM's mission is the computational modelling of these interactions. This entails, for example, a deep understanding of how narrative mechanisms such as continuity editing relate to larger historical patterns such as the emergence of new genres and audiences. Integrating film poetics and film history through scientific and creative computing is one of the long-term ambitions for our network. Such a model would in turn allow for the analysis of audiovisual archives at scale, enabling a new generation of applications for search and retrieval, but also opening these archives to new forms of creative interaction.

Through a programme of networking activities, the ARCAM network will enable the exchange of knowledge and methodologies that makes this interdisciplinary modelling possible, laying the groundwork for larger infrastructure and interoperability projects in the future. This COST Action represents a necessary first step towards a coherent approach to the computational analysis of Europe's audiovisual heritage and its application in capacity building for the future of its creative industries.



Europe has a rich and diverse tapestry of audiovisual cultural heritage, from historical newsreels to specialised industrial film archives to born-digital off-air television collections.
