_Creanalytics_: a portmanteau of creative and analytic.

This idea came up when writing about the computational video essay, largely in response to creative and analytic research methods coexisting under a unified computational framework in the age of generative AI. This could be understood as _generation_ through _prediction_, similar to the [analytic-synthetic distinction](https://www.williamcotton.com/articles/chatgpt-and-the-analytic-synthetic-distinction) which I found in this piece about [analytic augmentation in prompt engineering](https://github.com/williamcotton/empirical-philosophy/blob/main/articles/from-prompt-alchemy-to-prompt-engineering-an-introduction-to-analytic-agumentation.md).

Update: this is now an article! Forthcoming in a special Issue on critical technical practice in the journal [Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies]([https://journals.sagepub.com/home/con](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13548565231174592))

Also related to a project in collaboration with my colleagues [Jonathan Gray](https://jonathangray.org/) and [Mercedes Bunz](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/mercedes-bunz) on using video editing techniques as data analysis. We commissioned [Sam Lavigne](https://lav.io/) to work on his [[Videogrep]] tool.
