I directed this student-led project at [UAEMex](https://www.uaemex.mx/), the first online short-film festival in Mexico _Festival Online Futuros Astim√©tricos_. The programme showcased 90 selected pieces of animation, sound-art, net-art, and narrative short films, from over 20 countries, including Spain, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, USA, Canada, Germany, France, Portugal, Finland, Poland, Iran, etc. And included 18 conferences by international speakers.

Also during my time at UAEMex, I published [a book chapter](ri.uaemex.mx/handle/20.500.11799/32285) on massive online RPG architecture and the [famous prison etchings of Piranesi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carceri_d'invenzione). See [[Publications|my publications]] for more info.
