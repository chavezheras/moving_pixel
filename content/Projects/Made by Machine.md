I was invited to join a small team of developers, engineers and producers at BBC R&D to create “[the world’s first broadcast AI-TV programme](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2018-09-artificial-intelligence-archive-made-machine)”. In collaboration, we developed four computational techniques to browse the BBC television archive and automatically concatenate new sequences of clips, which were then packaged as the documentary [_Made by Machine: When AI Met the Archive_](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bhwk3p). The programme aired in 2018 on BBC Four, it was seen by nearly half a million people in the UK and was nominated for a Broadcast Tech Innovation award.

Other [clips are available here](https://vimeo.com/showcase/7158699). The entire programme can be seen through [Box of Broadcasts](https://learningonscreen.ac.uk/bob/) in the UK (with an education membership). I have written extensively about this project in my book [[../Publications/Cinema and Machine Vision profile|Cinema and Machine Vision]].
