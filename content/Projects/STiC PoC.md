## Qs from Geoffroy


>For me the most useful thing would be some use cases as discussed with Arianna at the last meeting. A set of use cases, for each
- what research question it serves
- how you'd translate it into one or more questions for the RAG and
- what answers would you expect to receive to help you with your analysis
- which structural & time units and metadata fields you think are relevant to answer it
- preferably some use cases that involve your hierarchy of time.



Research questions breakdown

Complex cultural systems
From sensing variations in signals and detecting patterns to identifying events across time; from static parts to dynamic systems.

A web of inter-subjective beliefs that emerges from the structured and sustained collective perception and understanding of media, a.k.a. meanings.

In the case cinema, meanings arise as audiences watch films.

Meanings are not found in isolation, in the films themselves or in the people who watch them, they are constructed collectively over time through sustained interaction.

To understand how meanings are produced, we can try to model these sustained interactions.

To model these sustained interactions, we need to look for traces of them. Some traces can be found in how films are made; the structural properties filmmakers use to elicit specific responses from their audiences (style/poetics). Other traces need to come from context; how these film are seen at any given time, by whom, and to what end (environment/psychology). Traces are incomplete, scattered, and always fading away. But their purposeful combination gives us the clearest possible picture of how meaning emerges.

Continuity
Film elicits responses by manipulating recorded past duration, i.e. by compressing or dilating time. Audiences imagine the time that is missing in compression or the time that is injected in dilation. The dialectics between continuity and discontinuity is key to this process. Human viewers learn to decode these elisions almost intuitively (there is some debate as to why they are able to do this).

Human viewers can also be trained to analyse this behaviour critically, to identify degrees and types of continuity, e.g. if units (usually shots) are continuous, contiguous, or discontinuos:


- Do the events in shot A happen immediately after the events in shot B?
	- If not, do they happen in the future (elision) or in the past (flash back)
- Do the events in shot A happen in the same place/environment as the events in shot B?
	- If not, do they happen in an adjacent place, a place that we have seen before, or in a different part altogether?

See Burch's matrix p. 

By making these shot transitions explicit, critics can infer patterns, for example degrees and types of continuity. Through repeated exposure over time, these patterns are thematised into aesthetic forms, e.g. genre, authorship, etc.



Style/poetics (bottom up)
Frames (objects)
- What is in the frame?
- How is it in the frame?
- What could be off the frame?

Shots (actions)
- What is happening
- Who/what is is happening to
- Where is it happening

Sequences of shots (events)
- Why is it happening
