ðŸŽ¤ I'm generally open to requests for public speaking, and I enjoy engaging with different audiences, from education to industry to policy; from keynotes to smaller research seminars; in **English** or in **Spanish**.

I am especially keen to talk about:
- AI and creative industries (especially film, TV, video platforms and videogames)
- Machine Vision (computer vision, philosophy of photography and film)
- Computational Humanities (cultural analytics, modelling, visualisation and simulation)
- Synthetic media and Generative AI (large language and vision models)
- Visual and Computational Cultures (past and present)
- Media history, theory, and technology (especially early cinema and historical poetics)

See [[Events/All events|past events]] to get a flavour of my public lectures and seminars for academic and non-academic audiences.

I have limited availability for public speaking. If you are interested in requesting a talk, the best way is through email, and it will save us both time if you provide the following information with your inquiry:

- A brief outline of your event's theme, format, and expected audience.
- Expected size of the event, including relevant links or information about previous editions.
- Other speakers who will also be invited.
- Whether the event will be recorded and how it will be disseminated.
- If the event is free to attend or if tickets will be sold.
- Indicate clearly if a speaker fee is available.

If you want to know more, please [[Contact|contact me]]. If I am already a speaker at your event and you need a bio, [[About me (bio)|click here]]. If you are interested in contacting me for consulting work, please see [[Consulting|this page]].
