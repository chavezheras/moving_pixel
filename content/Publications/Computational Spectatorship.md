### Abstract

Companion piece to the panel on [[Machine Feeling]] at Transmediale 2019. This publication was developed at a workshop held at University of Cambridge, and organised in collaboration with Transmediale festival, Aarhus University, and Cambridge Digital Humanities. The collection of short pieces focuses on machine learning and on the ability of technologies to capture and structure feelings and experiences that are active, in flux, and in the present.
