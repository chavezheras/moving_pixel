If you are current or former student and want a reference letter for further study, this page is for you.

Please note that I only write letters for my top students, usually those whose dissertations I supervised and occasionally some who achieved high marks or produced **outstanding work** in one or more of the modules I teach. This is because I can only write a few letters every year, but also because I tailor them carefully to highlight student's individual strengths  to specific programmes. I never write letter for students whom I never met or just because they were enrolled in one of my modules.

The upside of this approach is that the letters that I do write tend to be more effective (at least I think so). I had students getting admitted to very competitive programmes, including a student getting a full scholarship in a university ranked in the top 20 worldwide.

If you want to quest a reference letter, please [[Contact|email me]] with the following details:

- Your full name, programme and cohort at KCL
- Programme(s) that you are applying for
- Deadline(s) for application
- Your grades (attained or expected)
- **One paragraph** about your career ambitions and how the programme you selected will help you get there
