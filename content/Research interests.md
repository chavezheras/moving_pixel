## Main research themes and interests

![[assets/images/research_1.jpg|450]]

Most of my work falls in one of these overlapping categories:

- [Creative AI](https://creative-ai.org/) and interdisciplinary design
- Machine vision in moving image and media studies
- Synthetic media and generative approaches in computational humanities
- Critical technical practice, systems literacy, and computing cultures

Below is a screenshot of my [PURE profile "fingerprint"](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/daniel.chavez/fingerprints/)based on my [[Publications/All publications|All publications]]; for more details see [[Learn about my work|this note about my work]].
