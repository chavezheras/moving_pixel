## Main research themes and interests

![[assets/images/research_1.jpg|450]]

Most of my work falls in one of these overlapping categories:
- Computational moving image studies
- Computational creativity and creative computing
- Interdisciplinary design
- Synthetic media and generative approaches in computational humanities
- [Critical technical practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_technical_practice), systems literacy, and computing cultures

At King's, I am affiliated to the following groups:
- [Creative AI Lab](https://creative-ai.org/)
- [Computational Humanities Research Group](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/computational-humanities-research-group)
- [AI Institute](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ai)
- [Institute for Human and Synthetic Minds](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/kings-draws-together-expertise-to-make-the-world-healthier-and-advance-our-understanding-of-intelligence)(new)
