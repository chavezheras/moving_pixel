ðŸ“š As an advocate for interdisciplinary research, I am looking for prospective PhD students to join me in pursuing leading research at the intersection between culture and technology. You can read [[Learn more about my work|more about my work]], or see my [[Research interests|research interests]] or my [[Publications/Publications|publications]] to know more about the areas in which I work.

## About you
My **ideal doctoral student** is someone with a strong disciplinary background and technical skills, who has managed to "make the jump" between arts and sciences. This might include for example:

* Computer scientists, software engineers, or informatics majors, already proficient in computing but keen to expand their creative and critical skills towards media and creative industries.
* Technically minded arts and humanities students seeking to develop a strong computational practice that complements their theoretical interests in the history, theory and philosophy of media.

## About your project 
I aim to supervise students with projects that do not neatly fit in their current disciplines, and who are asking questions that require radical reciprocity between rigorous scientific and creative thinking. In particular, I am interested in doctoral projects that aim to do one or more of the following:

* Develop deep theoretical and practical understanding of computational media synthesis in the context of creative industries research, creative practices, and creative communities.
* Explore the role of machine learning and other forms of inductive computing in reshaping various industries, specifically film, architecture, music, and games (video and board).
* Re purpose, re-design existing scientific computing technologies across other disciplines and for research in creative domains and for the cultural sector, including GLAM and education.
* Leverage humanities and social sciences methods to understand the communities that design and use AI technologies.

## Why work with me?
I bring a combination of creative, technical, and academic expertise to the table, and I am well-equipped to facilitate interdisciplinary research, which is not as common in academia as one may think!
You will also have significant institutional support, including access to the college's compute infrastructure, as well as to opportunities to link with my network of partners and collaborators. Above all, you will have a supervisor that will challenge you to grow intellectually and support in your career ambitions. 

## How to approach?
First, read through the [Digital Humanities Research MPhil/PhD pages](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/areas/digital-humanities-research-mphil-phd)  to find relevant information about how to apply, deadlines, fees, and entry requirements. It can also be helpful to have a look at the [college's funding pages](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/funding). Once you know about all of this, [[Contact|get in touch!]] 

Send me an email with the subject line "possible PhD proposal", with a single paragraph that includes basic information about your background, your specific area of interest, and your idea for a doctoral project. Attach a one-page project proposal with the following sections:

1. Title
2. Research question
3. Outline of theoretical framework (1-2 paragraphs)
4. Proposed methods (can be a list)
5. Literature references

I aim to respond to these queries in a maximum of one week, but if you have not heard from me, please send me a reminder email!
