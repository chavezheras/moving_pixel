ðŸ“š As an advocate for interdisciplinary work, I am looking for PhD students to join me in pursuing high quality research at the intersection between culture and technology. You can read [[My work|more about my work]], or see my [[Research|research interests]] or my [[Publications/All publications|publications]] to know more about the areas in which I work.

## About you
My **ideal doctoral student** is someone with a strong disciplinary background and technical skills, who has managed to "make the jump" between arts and sciences. For example:

* Computer scientists, software engineers, or informatics majors, already proficient in computing but keen to expand their creative and critical skills towards humanities disciplines, media and creative industries. Students who read philosophy or a willing to learn.
* Technically minded arts and humanities students seeking to develop a strong computational practice that complements their theoretical interests in the history, theory and philosophy of media. Students who are familiar with data science, do some programming or a willing to learn.

## About your project 
I aim to supervise students with projects that require radical reciprocity between rigorous scientific and creative thinking. In particular, I am interested in doctoral projects that aim to do one or more of the following:

* Develop deep theoretical and practical understanding of computational media synthesis in the context of creative industries research, creative practices, and creative communities.
* Explore the role of machine learning and other forms of inductive computing in reshaping various industries, specifically film, architecture, music, and games (video and board).
* Re purpose and re-design existing scientific computing technologies across disciplines and for research in creative domains and for the cultural sector, including GLAM and education.
* Leverage humanities and social sciences methods to understand the communities that design and use AI technologies.

## Why work with me?
I bring a combination of creative, technical, and academic expertise to the table, and I am well-equipped to facilitate interdisciplinary research, which is not as common in academia as one may think!
I am also committed to negotiate the academic and institutional support you will need, including opportunities to link with my network of partners and collaborators, funding to attend and organise conferences and events to build your own network, access to archives and collections in the UK and internationally, training opportunities in and beyond the university offer, and access to infrastructure such as the college's high-performance computing cluster. I am also a fellow of the [Higher Education Academy](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/teaching-and-learning/psf)(a recognised framework for bench-marking success within higher education teaching and learning support). Above all, you can expect to work with a supervisor that will challenge you to grow intellectually and will support you in your own career ambitions.

## How to approach me?
First, read through the [Digital Humanities Research MPhil/PhD pages](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/areas/digital-humanities-research-mphil-phd)  to find relevant information about how to apply, deadlines, fees, and entry requirements. It can also be helpful to have a look at the [college's funding pages](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-research/funding). Once you know about all of this, send me an email with the subject line "PhD proposal", with a single paragraph that includes basic information about your background, your specific area of interest, and your idea for a doctoral project. Attach a one-page project proposal with the following sections:

1. Title
2. Research question
3. Outline of theoretical framework (1-2 paragraphs)
4. Proposed methods (can be a list)
5. Literature references

I aim to respond to these queries in a maximum of one week but by inbox can be hectic so please send me a reminder email if you don't hear from me! Ready to apply? [[Contact|get in touch!]]
