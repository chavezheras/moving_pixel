I very rarely tweet these days (it is not even called Twitter anymore!). I might not reply to DMs, and it is definitely not the best way to [[Contact|get in touch]], but still, [here is my profile](https://twitter.com/dchavezheras). I prefer [Mastodon](https://sigmoid.social/@chavezheras), but I'm really not really active in any of these platforms.

I also made an archive to keep outside the platforms, in [this page](https://movingpixel.net/twitter/) you can search many of my older tweets and view them in threaded form where relevant. This archive does not include replies to other people, just "standalone" tweets and threads. It was made with [this Twitter archiving tool](https://tinysubversions.com/twitter-archive/make-your-own/) by [Darius Kazemi](https://tinysubversions.com/).

I also exported [my Twitter bookmarks](https://movingpixel.net/twitter_bookmarks/).
