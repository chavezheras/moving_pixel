Welcome to my website. I am an academic and technologist, specialised in the computational production and analysis of visual culture. My work combines critical frameworks in the history and theories of cinema, television, and photography, with advanced technical practice in creative and scientific computing, including applied machine learning technologies (AI).

The relation between computational and visual cultures is central to my research, but I am curious about many other fields, and I find I am most productive when working across disciplines. Professionally, I have experience in the creative industries: print, digital and television; in Mexico and in the UK; with cultural institutions such as the British Council, and the BBC. I am now a Lecturer (≈Assistant Professor) in Digital Culture and Creative Computing at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/daniel-chavez-heras)  where I am part of the [Computational Humanities Group](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/computational-humanities-research-group), the [Creative AI Lab](https://creative-ai.org/info) (in partnership with the [Serpentine Galleries](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/))and an affiliate of [King's AI Institute](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ai). 

In this site I collect most of my activities as a "net of notes", similar in concept and ethos to a digital garden. Here are some ways into the notes that might be helpful depending on how and why you want to engage:
